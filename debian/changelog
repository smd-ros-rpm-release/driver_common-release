  * rosbuild2 taking shape
  * Added Ubuntu platform tags to manifest
  * driver_common: adding in brief descriptions
  * Added license notices.
  * Set reviewed tags on all packages.
  * Used boost::posix_time::microseconds instead of boost::posix_time::seconds to avoid rounding problems.
  * Rearranged condition variable in trigger matcher. No longer needs to use absolute times, and eliminated a race condition related to resetting the class.
  * hasTimestamp was inverted in previous checkin.
  * Added hasTimestamp method to the trigger matcher to determine if there is a timestamp waiting.
  * Marked timestamp_tools as internal only.
  * Marked timestamp_tools as internal only.
  * Remove use of deprecated rosbuild macros
  * Made trigger matcher less verbose by default.
  * added XHTML to description
  * Corrected Ptr to ConstPtr to make trigger_matcher callback compatible with
    subscribe.
  * Updated some debug messages in trigger_matcher.
  * Split TriggerMatcher into TriggerMatcher in which data is not queued and
    sent to a callback, and a QueuedTriggerMatcher with the previous
    functionality of TriggerMatcher.
  * Added a reset method to the TriggerMatcher
  * Wrote skeleton for PeriodicTimestampMinFilter.
  * Wrote TriggerMatcher class to synchronize exact trigger time stamps with
    approximate timestamps incoming from hardware. Wrote self tests for it.
  * First pass at writing the TriggerMatcher class. Duplicated the wge100 node
    in view of redoing the time stamping code.
  * Fixed typo in timestamp_tools manifest.
  * Renamed timestamp-tools to timestamp_tools.
